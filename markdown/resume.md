Experience
---------

As the founder and first employee of the Smiths Digital Forge in Silicon Valley.  The Smiths Digital Forge
was a software/digital innovation center created to serve the digital transformation of products made by a FTSE 100 company with a history in diversified industrials. I covered many roles with a single title.  The primary three roles were:

**CEO of the Smiths Digital Forge**

Created the design (physical and organizational) for the Smiths Digital Forge as a 
10K square foot R&D facility in Fremont, California.  Secured funding (~$4MM) for the facility, designed the internal MakerSpace (light
hardware prototyping lab), the IT infrastructure, etc.  Ran the operations of the Forge which grew from 5 to ~30 FTE - mostly engineers and scientists, with
program management and software operations.  Managed the budget (~$10MM/yr), overall project schedule, talent profile and headcount allocation.
Communicated with the Smiths ExCo and BoD, established a strategy for product digitization with the Smiths divisions, and accelerated the John Crane Sense digital product portfolio, bringing them to market in 2 years.  Secured funding for long term cross-division technology developments (such as a
hardened instrustrial gateway).  The Forge had the highest employee engagement and satisfaction scores across all of the enterprise,
and a culture of innovation and collaboration.

**CTO of the Smiths Digital Forge/CDO for Smiths Group**

Built the architecture roadmap for connected IIOT solutions for Smiths divisions.  Selected techologies,
platforms, and processes to promote agile development of new technolgies and fast time to market.  Developed strategies for where data should be stored based
on customer sensitivities, cost and regulatory requirements.  Hired, trained and managed a group of ~30 FTEs including software, hardware, test and algorithm engineers and scientists.  Mentored engineers in electrical, and software technologies.  Communicated with the CTOs of the Smiths divisions to ensure alignment of work with the vision of the divisions.  Developed the process for tracking and reporting on innovation projects (~40 at a time) through the TRL 4-9 range.

**Technical Lead**

Designed the electronics (schematic, PCBA, etc) for high speed cloud-connected data acquisition systems.  Selected components for industrial temperature-critical systems, including critical ADCs for sensor types with various precision and speed requirements.  Wrote the FPGA gateware to manage 56 separate
data acquisition channels fed into an embedded imx7 (Freescale) processor for analysis and transport to the cloud.  Designed and implemented a soft real time
analysis pipeline in Rust for on-edge analytics.  Developed a cloud infrastructure based on SAAS and later PAAS components (initially in Azure, and
then later cloud-agnostic) for hosting rich telemetry data, and running analytics, etc.  Selected and prototyped the observability stack.  Invented, prototyped
and productized a high performance, low cost time series database for rich telemetry written in Asynchronous Rust.  Developed a mechatronics infrastructure
and UI system for a medical infusion pump.
